This project is unofficial Android client for Travis CI. 

It uses [API v2](http://docs.travis-ci.com/api/#overview) from Travis CI for fetching all required information about repositories, build tasks and build history.
The app has the following features:
- user login to Travis CI and Travis CI Pro
- list of repositories
- build history
- build log
- restart/cancel build
- search with history
- intent filter for opening build links
